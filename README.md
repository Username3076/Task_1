# Task_1
Task 1 for the Geosoftware course 2021

Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Geosoftware course!

This repository contains:
    - The necessary data with the route.js and polygon.js in the data folder
    - The "task_1.js" where you can find my Java Script code
    - the "webpage.html" where you can find my HTML code

Unfortunatly I wasnt able to finish the entire task, particularly the HTML-integration of the javascript code. the javascript code itself works fine, for the most part. 
But it was hard for me to connect my result with my webpage, so most of it is only visible in the console.
