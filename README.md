# Task2
Task 2 for the Geosoftware course 2021

Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Geosoftware course!

This repository contains:
    - The necessary data with the route.js and polygon.js
    - The "Task2.js" where you can find my Java Script code
    - the "webpage2.html" where you can find my HTML code

Unfortunatly I wasnt able to find my mistake. Even when I use the "default run" button, which is supposed to run the old code from Task1, it still gives me an error. I know, that my isInsideArray is filled with wrong elements, but i cannot find the reason, i just guess it has to do with the polygon, it originally took
